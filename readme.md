# A Chromium and Chrome extension that overwrites the new tab

##The problem
I want to show the date and time in the new Chromium and Chrome tab.
There are many extensions for this purpose, but all of them have many extra features that I don't want and many tracking scripts that I don't want too.

##The solution
The aim of the project is to have fun and learn something.
Chrome offers the ability to install custom local extensions and use its own API.

##Next step
Use this extension to also display system information (battery status, wifi connection ...) reading a json generated by Conky (or a similar program or a customized bash script ?!)
